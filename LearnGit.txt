git status			// Shows that we've got changes on index.html and two untracked files
git add '*.html'	~or~	git add -A		// Adds all files to the repository.
// Note: When we even modify a file we should add it again. Here index.html was added or we add all the files, modified or new ones
git commit -m 'new files added and index modified'

git log
git diff head -u	// Displays changes occured in the last (head) files
git diff --staged	// What has changed in the staged files
git reset page1.html	// Unstages page1.html , so the file would not be comitted unless we add it again
git checkout -- page1.html	// Ignores all the uncommited changes of page1.html and changes it to the last committed one

git branch			// Returns the branches. The main branch is called master
git branch fixpages	// Makes a new branch and copies the current files in it. The current branch will be unchanged: master
git checkout fixpages	// Now we switch into the new branch
